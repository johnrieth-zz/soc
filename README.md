# U.S. Army Special Operations Command Website Redesign

## Welcome!

This repository contains a prototype of a redesigned website for the Joint Communications Unit. [Current JCU website](http://jcu.mil). 

This README is [adapted from 18F](https://github.com/18F/afrs-pa/blob/master/README.md)

### JCU

The mission of the Joint Communications Unit is to ensure that the communications procedures and equipment work reliably and effectively for the Joint Special Operations Command and its subordinate units.

## Users and stakeholders

Potential users are current military personnel and civilians who are interested in joining the unit.

Stakeholders are likely to be JCU recruiters, Joint Special Operations Command, and the Department of Defense.

## System

The current system appears to be using DotNetNuke, a .NET based CMS. This repository uses ASP.NET Core Razor Pages 2.1 because Razor Pages is a quick way to create a .NET page based website.  [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) could be a good use as the website seems to not need to be updated frequently enough to need a CMS.

## Product vision

- Presents potential recruits a functional, modern interface
- Secure site that complies with the [HTTPS-Only Standard](https://https.cio.gov/)
- Uses U.S. Web Design System to build upon proven code.

## Success metrics

- Increase the number of high-quality recruits
